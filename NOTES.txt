### Implementation notes

The plugin is trying to use the mod_lti libraries and implementations as much as possible.
The aim is to list preconfigured external tools and eventually display a content selector if this
is set in the external tool.

However, there are a couple of setback:
* Most of the LTI API function need to have a module id attached to the instance/iframe. There
are hopefully not necessary in all callback and set to 0 whenever possible
* We tried to use the external.php library from the mod_lti but get_tool_types for example was
not retuning the config for the tool so we did not know how to handle the content selector for this
kind of resources.
